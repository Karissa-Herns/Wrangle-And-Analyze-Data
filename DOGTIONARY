## 📖 Data Dictionary, AKA Dogtionary: Dog Stage Definitions

Below are definitions of common dog-related terms used in this project:

### **Doggo**
**/ˈdôɡō/** *(noun)*  
1. A big pupper, usually older. This label does not stop a doggo from behaving like a pupper.  
2. A pupper that appears to have its life in order. Probably understands taxes and whatnot.  
   _Example: “That’s a really good doggo.”_

### **Pupper**
**/ˈpʌpər/** *(noun)*  
1. A small doggo, usually younger. Can be equally, if not more mature than some doggos.  
2. A doggo that is inexperienced, unfamiliar, or in any way unprepared for the responsibilities associated with being a doggo.  
   _Example: “H*ck, that’s one pettable pupper.”_

### **Puppo**
**/ˈpʌpō/** *(noun)*  
1. A transitional phase between pupper and doggo. Easily understood as the dog equivalent of a teenager.  
2. A dog with a mix of both pupper and doggo tendencies.  
   _Example: “My puppo is still learning what it takes to be a trustworthy doggo.”_

### **Blep**
**/ˈblɛp/** *(verb)*  
1. An extremely subtle act that occurs without the knowledge of the one who slips. The act includes one’s tongue protruding ever so slightly from the mouth, usually just noticeable enough that it attracts the attention it deserves. Can last between three seconds and four days.  
   _Example: “My doggo did a h*ck of a blep the other day.”_

### **Snoot**
**/snuːt/** *(noun)*  
1. The nose of a dog. Usually found in places the dog may not fit. The location of the snoot may hint at where the dog’s interest lies.  
   _Example: “That is a beautiful snoot.”_

### **Floof**
**/fluːf/** *(noun)*  
1. Any dog, really. However, this label is commonly given to dogs with seemingly excessive fur. Comical amounts of fur on a dog will certainly earn the dog this generic name.  
2. Dog fur. The term holds true whether the fur is still on the dog, or if it has been shed off.  
   _Example: “Check out that majestic floof!”_
