This project was completed as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.

WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that posts and rates pictures of dogs. These ratings often are not serious and have numerators that are greater than the denominators. In this analysis, I mostly focus on wrangling WeRateDogs's Twitter archive through August 1, 2017. Most of the necessary Twitter data has been provided by Udacity and includes information on each post, as well as details on each dog such as the name, rating, and stage (whether the dog is a doggo, floofer, pupper, or puppo). See below for definitions on the dog stages.
